I am going to try to see if I can improve the performance 
of the SweetNet Graph Neural network by using the pre-trained 
values of embeddings of a Glycan Language Model as features 
at the start of training to see if the relationships they 
have captured through training improves the predictive 
capabilities of the new hybrid model.

Top level requirements

Must have:
    !Getting SweetNet Up and running (2025-04-11)
    Infusing SweetNet with GLM Embeddings (2025-04-25)
    Test And compare infused model to original (2025-05-02)
Should have:
    Hyperparameter Optimized SweetNet
    Applying SweetNet to specific problem
Could have:
    Tinkering with SweetNet Structure (birthing new model)
Wonâ€™t have at this time (for future projects):
