# Unsorted
- Immunigenicity, glycolycation dataset to get system up and running
- I'm using embeddings from smallest model, might be nice to use 35 mil model, 
- Best to compare to model of similar size.
- Universal approximation theory
- The bigger the model the sweeter the juice
- Adding one layer allows you to reduce model by x
- Could just copy sweetnhet and make it override the import
- don't have too many cells, try to keep many things in one cell.
- Multilabel classification, one sample with multiple labers. Use sigmoid function
- USe gifflar code benchmarks.py and look for other data and code. code to turn pairs into multi-label
