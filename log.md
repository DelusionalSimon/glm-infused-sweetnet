# Prework
- Deep delve
- Lipophilicity GNN project to familiarize myself
- Planned project
  - Started out in more complex project planning system
  - Defined scope
  - Broke down into milestones
  - Moved to simplified PDD
- Planned first prototype
# Prototype 0 Basic sweetnet
- Registered on Github
- Forked glycowork
- Made a new branch of dev branch
- Installed Git
- Local clone set up
- Installed VS Code to work in
- Installed Miniconda for virtual environment
- editable install setup for glycowork
- Set up second repo for my experimentation to live in
- Couldn't get basic stuff to work 
- Google colab tests as sanity check
- About to skip editable install
- Caught an error in my install.
- I did a fresh conda environment and got it working
- Set up pre-trained SweetNet
- imported data to test it
- Started writing evaluator
- Couldn't figure out what data it expected
- Found code snippet to train a quick SweetNet
- Couln't get it to work due to auroc errors
- tried to fix the bug
- managed to train the model nicely!
- Found that my fix just made auroc Nan
- Reverted back using git
- created a divergence by mistake
- Fixed with force. will use revert rather than reset in future
- First sweetnet is up and running and working well. its accuracy matches the values found in the sweetnet paper
- Prototype 0 is done, time to define prototype 1
# Prototype 1 GLM-Infused Sweetnet
- Set up Jupyter notebook structure 
- Got Embedding data imported
- Through exploration of embeddings
- Loaded glyconet library
- They correspond one to one!
- I successfully ran the SweetNet, init_weights, and Prep_model code from cells, and the  training worked
- I split the kingdom model running code into two cells to not have to load the data each time
